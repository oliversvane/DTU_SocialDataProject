                <h2 class="anchor" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Since the industrial revolution the global economy has grown drastically. The rise in income have lifted millions out of poverty, and given them the means to buy what they desire in their life. However, it has been fueled by an increasing population and rate of unprecedented comsumption. The rising demand, use of fossil fuels has resulted in dramatic levels of polution, decreased biodiversity, reduced air quality etc. We as a race consumes more natural resources by August, than the earth can regenrate every year. If we want to keep our living standard, and not keep abusing the earths resources while slowly frying it, we need to optimize how we use and recycle resources. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-07-humans-depleting-earth-resources-footprint.html">1 - phys.org/</a></p>
                <p>Denmark has one of the highest rates of CO2 emissions per capita, we emit 53 million tons of CO2 alone from burning coal, oil and gas, which are partially used for heating and electricty generation. Roughly 15% of the danes emission comes from the production of electricty which primarliy are used in their houses for freezers, lighting etc.  26% of the danes emissions comes from the production of heat, which are used houses, water etc. It is clear that a reduction in the energi consumption of our houses, would greatly contribute to reducing Denmarks overall emission impact. But how do you know whether you have a &quot;Green&quot; house? <a href="https://www.okolariet.dk/viden-om/klima/ideer-til-skolen-klima/inspirationsmateriale-niveau-2/co2-i-hjemmet">2 - okolariet.dk</a></p>
                <p>In Denmark Energy labels were introduced in 2010. The energy labels is in short a document that describes the condition of a building im terms of energy consumption. The Energy labels lets potential buys of a house know how energy-econmic the house is, what the yearly consumption and price of water, heating and electricty but also let potential buyers know how much it would cost to renovate the house to make it even more energy efficient.</p>
                <p>In this website we will investigate how the buildings in Greater Copenhagen compare to each other, in terms of materials, Energy Labels, municipalities and the wealth of it. A machine learning model will also be created to see if we can predict what energy-labels a house based on the materials and other attributes of the building.<a href="https://www.nettopower.dk/nyheder/energimaerkning">3 - nettopower.dk</a></p>
                <h2 class="anchor" id="state">The current state of the buildings in the Greater Copenhagen area</h2>
                <p>In order to get the most out of this article, it is important understand the current state of buildings in the greater Copenhagen area. In the visual below it is possible to explore the distribution and counts of multiple parameters related to the buildings. Please choose attributes for x and a attribute for the label to generate dynamic plots.</p>
                <p>Following interesting observations can be made if you choose the following combinations:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p>X-axis: Heat Supply, Label: Kommune <br/> It is quite clear that different heat systems are used in different municipalities. For an example Copenhagen is big on on disctrict heat, while Lyngby Tårbæk is uses primarily Gas. We can also see that almost all municipalites use cover a small percentage of their hearting supply with either oil or electricity.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>X-axis: Energy Label, Label: Kommune <br/>
                This plot give an a nice overview of how the energy labels are distributed between the municipalities. The first impression you get is that the amount of energy labels are relativly evenly distributed between the municipalities compared to their size.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>X-axis: Kommune, Label: Current Use <br/>
                This plot show how buildings are used across the municipalities. It is clear to see here that in Frederiksberg and Copenhagen there seem to be a lot Collectives compared to other municipalties. So a lot of people living in the same apartment, and therefore the energy usage would most likely be higher than a normal residential building.</p>

                <p>To get a better understanding of the current construction trends, here is a histogram showing the distribution of contsruction year. If you choose the bin size = 50, each bins roughly represents 10 years. We can see a the majority of the buildings in greater Copenhagen are constructed in the 1940, 1960, 1970 and 1980. Back then we did not have the same focus and technology for isolation, energy and water consumption. Therefore buildings from this age can not be expected to have a great energy label, however they should fair a lot better than very old buildings from before the 1920&#39;s</p>

                <p>The heatmap below shows how the buildings in Greater Copenhagen is distributed. It is clear to see the further away from Copenhagen you get the lower the more spread out the clusters of buildings becomes. If you zoom all they way in you will also see that it is far from all buildings we have in every area of the map.</p>

                <h2 id="tren">Building Trends of Energy Labels</h2>
                <p>Now that you have gotten an overview of  the general landscape of the buildings in Greater Copenhagen, we are ready to take a closer look and analyse our findings. </p>   
                <p>The first plot is a heatmap over time, showing when the buildings are currently classified with an energy label “A”. It can clearly be seen that very few buildings show up for each frame before the year 2000, but after that the number increases drastically. This aligns well with what you would have found if you had chosen &quot;X-axis: Year of construction interval&quot;, Label: “Energy Label” in the bar plot above. The additional information we get here is we can see exactly where the buildings are located and not just in what municipality. It can be seen that the buildings are actually quite spread out, with bigger clusters here and there. Vise versa, if you choose G you can see a lot of buildings before the 1980, but almost none after. </p>   
                <p>Another cool thing that can be seen from the plot is if you choose all energy labels. This is effectively showing you how the city of Copenhagen has evolved since the 1500&#39;s. It can be seen that in the 1700&#39;s and the 1800&#39;s until the start of the 1900&#39;s, that majority of the buildings are within the inner city, however new buildings here have stopped and are slowly moving away from the city center. Then in the last 10 years a lot of buildings are being built within Copenhagen and the outskirts again, presuming old buildings are demolished making space for newer and more efficient ones. </p>   
                <p>Now it is your turn to explore; take a look at the different energy labels clicking the different categories below.</p>

                </div>


                <p>We have seen that the heating supply differs quite a bit depending on which municipality you are in. But what about the building materials of the buildings? </p>
                <p>To get a better understanding of the construction material of the dwellings, the following map allows you to view the location of buildings with different construction attributes. If you start with looking at the wall materials, it could be suspected that areas north of Copenhagen might use more expensive materials for their walls such as masonry. This is also represented in the heatmap, the concentration of masonry walls are considerably higher inside Copenhagen and north of Copenhagen.</p>
                <p>If we look at the different types of roofing materials, we can again assume that some of the more expensive options are better represented in the north of Copenhagen such clay tiles, Thatch or Glass. If you look through the different options on the heatmap we do not see the same concentration as before. Another important thing to take into account regarding the materials is, that the more expensives ones are not necessarily the most "green" or efficents ones, an example could be a glass roof.</p>
                
                <div class="viz" id="viz8">
                    <div id="viz8_container" style="max-height: 600px;"> <img style="display:block; margin:auto;" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/loading.gif')}}" alt="loading"></div>
                </div>
                <p>We have seen that the materials of the buildings in our case don't necessarily dictate what energy label a building has, we have also seen that it does not really matter in what area of Greater Copenhagen the building is for its energy label. This is illustrated in the Geo-plot below where the municipalities are highlighted, if you hover over them, a tooltip with their energy label distribution is shown. The color of the municipalities shows its “average” energy label. Energy labels are represented as numbers by: A - 6, B - 5 … G - 0.</p>
                
                <h2 class="anchor" id="prediction">Prediction part</h2>
                <p>Based on our findings, you might be curious how your house is fairing, and what energy label it should get? Luckily for you we have embedded a machine learning model for this website that can predict the energy label if buildings using basic information. The model predictions are not completely bulletproof but will give a reasonable estimate which is fairly reliable plus minus one level of the Energy Label. If you are unsure about some of the information in your building, feel free to try multiple different combinations out. If the specific material in you roof or walls are missing choose &quot;other - unpopulated&quot;.</p>
